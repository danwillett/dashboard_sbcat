          The Active Transportation Data Dashboard was developed through a Regional Early
          Action Planning (REAP) Grant from the State of California to support regional
          planning and data-driven decision-making. This dashboard provides Santa Barbara
          County with a centralized home for spatial data on bicycle and pedestrian safety,
          travel volumes, infrastructure, and equity. It was created to give planners,
          researchers, and community members a tool to better understand and improve active
          transportation across the region.
